Why is it important to choose a license?

To learn what happens if you don't choose a license, I read ![GitHub's choosealicense page](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/) on the subject. Without a license, the default assumption is an exclusive copyright, which turns messy if the project has more than one contributor- are *you* allowed to modify the work anymore? A good license allows developers who is allowed to contribute to the source code, and whether or not any distributions of your work *also* have to be open-source (GNU GPLv3). Finally, the choosealicense page mentions how "businesses and savvy developers won't touch a project without this protection," and they're right; a license is an industry standard.

Why shouldn't you use a project that lacks an explicit license?

Carrying on from the last question, then, projects without an explicit license have to be avoided because they're not open-source, they're under the default exclusive copyright. Without any ability to modify or even copy the work, you can't work with them and they can't work with you. If this project is the best alternative, your options are to create an issue or pull request and *suggest* a license for them, or try to work out some private agreement. But if they've made an oversight like this and have no license, you may just want to look at a licensed alternative.

![Why the Web beat Gopher](https://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain) - do you agree with this claim?

I'll preface this with the fact that my only knowledge of Gopher comes from this reading, but in general I can agree with its claims. Having seen open source in action I can easily agree with Raymond's claim that opening up a software for the userbase to become contributors can easily multiply a project's human resources, which was one advantage the Web had over Gopher. Licensing and internet standards, and even forking, were either caused by the smaller userbase and support of the hackers, or added to the divide between Gopher and the web. At the same time, I also agree with other explanations from the same site: the Bad Publicity section mentions how the World Wide Web was growing in popularity compared to Gopher because of a better documentation and menu system. This seems just as valid an explanation, and the site has many more ways to explain just what happened to Gopher.

# Part 6
Can you justify why Linux chose the GPL v2 license based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project?

Linus Torvalds chose the GPL v2 license for Linux for the same reason he developed the Linux kernel- he ![wanted to work on an operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#Creation), but existing operating systems (MINIX, Unix) had either more limited licenses or were proprietary. In fact, the GNU Project was created in direct opposition to the proprietary Unix model. The GNU GPL v2 was the first copyleft license, which meant any derivative works from a GPL v2 project had to stay as free software. Linus's goal was to develop his operating system and then phase out all MINIX components, and the GNU GPL offered his contributors a way to help while preventing a proprietary takeover.
