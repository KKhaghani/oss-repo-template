Why is it important to choose a license?

To learn what happens if you don't choose a license, I read ![GitHub's choosealicense page](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/) on the subject. Without a license, the default assumption is an exclusive copyright, which turns messy if the project has more than one contributor- are *you* allowed to modify the work anymore? A good license allows developers who is allowed to contribute to the source code, and whether or not any distributions of your work *also* have to be open-source (GNU GPLv3). Finally, the choosealicense page mentions how "businesses and savvy developers won't touch a project without this protection," and they're right; a license is an industry standard.

Why shouldn't you use a project that lacks an explicit license?

Carrying on from the last question, then, projects without an explicit license have to be avoided because they're not open-source, they're under the default exclusive copyright. Without any ability to modify or even copy the work, you can't work with them and they can't work with you. If this project is the best alternative, your options are to create an issue or pull request and *suggest* a license for them, or try to work out some private agreement. But if they've made an oversight like this and have no license, you may just want to look at a licensed alternative.
