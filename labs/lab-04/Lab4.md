Why is it important to choose a license?

To learn what happens if you don't choose a license, I read ![GitHub's choosealicense page](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/) on the subject. Without a license, the default assumption is an exclusive copyright, which turns messy if the project has more than one contributor- are *you* allowed to modify the work anymore? A good license allows developers who is allowed to contribute to the source code, and whether or not any distributions of your work *also* have to be open-source (GNU GPLv3). Finally, the choosealicense page mentions how "businesses and savvy developers won't touch a project without this protection," and they're right; a license is an industry standard.
