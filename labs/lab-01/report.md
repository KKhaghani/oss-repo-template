# Lab 01 Report - Introduction to Open Source Software

#### The Open Source Definition sets an important standard, a high standard. Free redistribution is probably the most obvious part of the definition, but one criterion that surprised me was that the license must not restrict other software (#9). 
#### Smart Questions's introduction blew me away with how accurately it depicted sites like StackOverflow- people are willing to help and say "Good question," but only if the user has put in the work and doesn't ask a question that has already been answered twice over.
#### Two more suggestions for Answering Questions in a Helpful Way:
 * If a question can be answered in multiple ways, or there are multiple solutions, point some of them out! Other users tend to add solutions in case the first solution fails.
 * When a question points out a known issue, don't just say it's a known bug- pass it along to the software maintainer and let them know the bug is still ongoing.
## Free Culture, chapter 3:
#### What is strangest to me is why this chapter was titled 'Catalogs,' as opposed to 'Thieves,' 'Villains,' or something more accurate. In fact, 'Catalogs' never appears once within the body of chapter 3.
